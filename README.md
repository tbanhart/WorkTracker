# WorkTracker2

This is the WorkTracker designed for DST Systems. The program was created for the correspondence department, in order to properly record
outgoing mail to ensure quality and timeliness of mail. It gives the functionality to populate and print quality control sheets that record
the basic information for letters sent out. The additional functionality is provided to push the letter information to a database to allow
management to quickly and easily search for details on a specific letter. Additional information and specifications are available in the 
documentation available in the program's help menu, or by downloading and opening the HTML files located in the main program's Pages folder
in your preferred browser.

Any questions can be located to the developer, Trevor Banhart at tbanhart11@gmail.com. Thank you for your time, and enjoy the program.
